We mainly had a discussion around how adoption of Web3 can increase and the use cases that are useful to different users.

## Why would a user use Web3?
* Censorship
* Archiving data
* Switching costs
* Offline capabilities

Discussed the [adoption curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle). Web3 is still on innovators.

## Other discussion points
* Textile easy login with email may help adoption
* Even if users could freely switch services and bring their data along, will companies still accumulate user data?
* Autonomous cars and IoT may *need* p2p networks
  - What about 5G networks? The telecom industry is talking all about 5G to help autonomous cars, but not p2p networks
  - Autonomous cars communicating should literally mean they are communicating with each other directly, and not going through some server hundreds of miles away
* Mesh networking *needs* p2p networks
* Consumers don't *need* Web2 or Web3, they need use cases
* Many Web3 technologies rely on people taking advantage of spare resources (blockchain mining, extra storage, etc). Can this scale?
* What are technologies that *need* Web3, without being created from Web3 itself?
  - For example, blockchains are created from Web3, autonomous cars may need Web3
* Discussed p2p chat apps like [Firechat](https://www.opengarden.com/firechat/) and how they handle network partitions
  - Would users adopt a p2p chat app just from the use case of being able to chat in large crowds with poor cell coverage?
* Why would developers use Web3?
  - New business models are needed?
